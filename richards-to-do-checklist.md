# Richard's To Do Checklist

> Tie park experience to access points\(uploaded on AGOL\), investigate creation of new routes, 
>
> _**Look into creating tool that lists all amenities for a given park: at first glance it looks like we can through the layer on the map and cursor through with a conditional and will return the field name if the condition is met - doesn't even necessarily have to be a map, but the spatial component of comparing would be nice.**_
>
> 1. Consolidate from park locator into park polygons or just use points \(clean up the park locator data\)
>    1. Would have to clean data up. Maybe have each park hold an array
> 2. Turn dataset into geojson?
> 3. Have two containers that hold info for park you select where you can compare two?
> 4. On click, check condition for amenity fields, if pass show in container
>    1. maybe pass all to temp arr then display from temp arr

### Here's what you need to catch up writing on

* \[ \] REST API
  * \[ \] You looked a little at this, there will definitely be more later
* \[ \] Document Processes
  * \[ p \] Try to document creating your apps to show best practices and such
* \[ \] Create documentation on types of apps and when it is best to use them, especially ArcGIS packages, general considerations when going to build such as length of time, difficulty, cost considerations, software used, data sources, delivery and audience
  * \[ \] Crowd Source
  * \[ \] Web App Builder
  * \[ \] Story Maps
  * \[ \] Mobile Maps
  * \[ \] Custom \(Leaflet or otherwise\) &gt; You need a method of delivery - it has to sit on a server somewhere
* Occupy empty pages you placed with notes and research you've conducted on said topic
* Are there any tools/services you looked at that are worth documenting?
