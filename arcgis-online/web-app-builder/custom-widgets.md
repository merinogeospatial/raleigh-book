# Custom Widgets

My repo of custom widgets: 

[https://github.com/merinogeospatial/agol-custom-widgets/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/merinogeospatial/agol-custom-widgets/blob/master/README.md)

{% embed data="{\"url\":\"https://developers.arcgis.com/web-appbuilder/sample-code/create-custom-in-panel-widget.htm\",\"type\":\"link\",\"title\":\"Create a custom in-panel widgetâ€”Web AppBuilder for ArcGIS \(Developer Edition\) \| ArcGIS for Developers\",\"description\":\"Create a basic custom widget with the CustomWidget template.\",\"icon\":{\"type\":\"icon\",\"url\":\"https://developers.arcgis.com/favicon.ico\",\"aspectRatio\":0},\"caption\":\"This link will get you started in building your own widgets to extend AGOL\"}" %}

Be sure to set names the same across the board \(in js, manifest, etc.\). If you fail to do this, you will have an error when trying to add it in WAB. A good way to tell is if the icon image does not load in your app pool!

Note how things interact with one another.
