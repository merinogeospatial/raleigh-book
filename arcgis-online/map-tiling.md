# Vector Map Tiling

## Why use map tiles?

Map tiles are a good way to publish layers that will only be used for reference and not be editable for online maps. A main benefit to map tiling from experience is the scalability of labels, which is limited for AGOL feature layers. In order to reconfigure your styles and labels after publishing, you may update it by manipulating the json file of your tile item: 

{% embed data="{\"url\":\"https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/create-maps/update-vector-tile-style.htm\",\"type\":\"link\",\"title\":\"Update vector tile layer styleâ€”ArcGIS Online Help \| ArcGIS\",\"description\":\"When you update the style for a hosted vector tile layer, the updated style is applied to the original vector tile layer.   However, the updated style shows as a new vector tile layer, and it has a different item ID than the original layer.\",\"icon\":{\"type\":\"icon\",\"url\":\"https://doc.arcgis.com/assets/img/favicon.ico\",\"aspectRatio\":0}}" %}



## Publishing map tiles from ArcGIS Pro

In order to publish map tiles and vector map tiles from ArcGIS Pro, you must first verify that you are a level 2 named user with tile publishing rights. You may check what kind of role you have in the "My Profile" section of your account.
