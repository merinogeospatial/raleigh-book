# Vector Map Tiling

## Why use map tiles?

Map tiles are a good way to publish layers that will only be used for reference and not be editable for online maps. A main benefit to map tiling from experience is the scalability of labels, which is limited for AGOL feature layers. In order to reconfigure your styles and labels after publishing, you may update it by manipulating the json file of your tile item:

However, the updated style shows as a new vector tile layer, and it has a different item ID than the original layer.\",\"icon\":{\"type\":\"icon\",\"url\":\"https://doc.arcgis.com/assets/img/favicon.ico\",\"aspectRatio\":0}}" %}



## Publishing map tiles from ArcGIS Pro

In order to publish map tiles and vector map tiles from ArcGIS Pro, you must first verify that you are a level 2 named user with tile publishing rights. You may check what kind of role you have in the "My Profile" section of your account. You may style and label how you would want your tile to look from an ArcGIS Pro map. Note that there may be some slight differences in what you style locally and the export you create online. An example if this would be some text appearing slightly larger when pushed online. Check out the guide below:
