# Data Consolidation for AGOL

## Task: Develop a Collector app for David Hamilton to be able to collect and update various greenway assets.

### &lt;Track datasets here&gt;

* Created copy of sign personal geodatabase @ \GISDATA\Base Data\Sign\_Inventory\(20180501\).gdb
* Created local copy of Greenway Asset Inventory
  * Local copy cooked and exported to local set
  * Cooked data to be merged with signs
* \*Copy view? &gt; Could not &gt; Asking IT to get ownership transferred
* Spoke with Jeff, allow picture attachments for both but advise on discretion
* \*\*\* Sharing to Raleigh Parks group, probably still need settings changed to share with this group?
* Talk to David for demo
  * Mention fields
  * Mention possibility of duplicate data for some signs
  * Give how-to

    * Offer field demo

## Creation + Consolidation of authoritative datasets in AGOL

For the strategic planning initiative, they are interested in the following assets:

•	Benches \| B:\GISDATA\Cityworks\_Parks\Data\Asset\_Inventory.mdb\Site\_Furnishings

•	Bike Racks \| B:\GISDATA\Cityworks\_Parks\Data\Asset\_Inventory.mdb\Site\_Furnishings

•	Comfort Stations

•	Drinking Fountains \| This is in Rgreenways, public data

•	Greenway Parking \| Have the dataset on online for a map I made, forgot where I got it.. SDE?

•	Interpretive Signs

•	Light Poles

•	Observation Stations

•	Public Art \| Data set made, made soemthing for Shawsheen

•	Signs

•	Trash & Recycling Receptacles \| 

B:\GISDATA\Cityworks\_Parks\Data\Asset\_Inventory.mdb\Site\_Furnishings

**Make a data punch list with all priority attributes - this should include a gauge of how complete the dataset is/ Completeness gauged on geometry, attributes, format, source location**

Will this become sole authoritative? All in group &gt; views
