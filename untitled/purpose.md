# Purpose

This book will contain research and methods related to coding, GIS, and projects. This book may be useful to use as reference for myself in looking back at past work and research, or it may serve as a guide for colleagues seeking to tackle these topics. This should \(hopefully\) save time when it comes to digging up reference material and serve as a report of findings.
