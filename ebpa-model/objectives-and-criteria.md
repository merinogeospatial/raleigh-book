# Objectives and Criteria

**Experience-Based Access Model - MCSDSS**

**Team Goal List  
**

**Team Goal: Gain confidence in analysis/model results in order to be used in “official” capacity**

* * * **How do we get this? Criteria &gt;**
      * **We have commited to choices on parameters: distance used, analysis logic, weights, scoring \(to be thorough as possible\)**
      * **We have ensured that these choices are backed by literature, restraints, common collective understanding/agreement**
      * **We have examined for holes in our logic and addressed them in some way through inclusion of more variables, refining logic/methodology, or agreement to exclude in scale**
      * **We have ensured our data is up to date and “clean” to our prescribed specs**

**Team Goal: Have the best possible data to work with**

* * * **How do we evaluate success of this action? Criteria &gt;**
      * **We have verified that all required attributes are present in order for complete analysis of model**
      * **We have verified all data is the latest**
      * **We have verified data is in format that can be easily integrated/changed for model**
      * **We have evaluated parks/access point data and deem it ready per prescribed specifications**
      * **We have evaluated network data and deem it ready...**

**Team Goal: Have extensive documentation on methodology, processes, data, and model**

* * * **What do we need to obtain this? Criteria &gt;**
      * **We have created documentation for x,y,z**
      * **We have verified with outside party that our documentation is clear and makes sense**
      * **Data, code, documents, and model flow has been standardized to best practice**

**Team Goal: Have a dialogue system \(GIS\) between model and users \(planners\) w/ scenario testing**

* **Criteria &gt;**
  * **We have agreed to the best framework to deliver this interface to our model, accounting for tech restrictions, ease of access, runtime, etc.**
