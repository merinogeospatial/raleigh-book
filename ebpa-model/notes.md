# Notes

Personal notes - not official info/sharing method for EBPA, but here for viewing

## 20180412

* Configuring widgets for statistical views, presentation, filtering by location and selection \(downtown vs. other\)
* Web apps with analysis enabled, keeping credits in mind

### To do list for next meeting:

* \[ x \] If I create web app templates - will level 1 users be able to configure them?
  * _**TJ is same publisher as me, should be able to configure apps\***_
* \[ x \] Brainstorm questions for Bonnie, specific points on organization.
* ~~\[ \] Dive into researching the model, take notes on the process, variables, inputs, objectives~~
  * ~~\[ \] Maybe come up with a rough diagram \(or wait\)~~

## 20180416

* Discuss preparation with Bonnie - questions to ask, things to bring up, background to give

  Logic Model Draft

  * Describe the situation
  * Short, medium, and long term output impacts
  * List of activities - possible and expected out puts
  * List of limitations and assumptions
    * How will we establish best practices for this project
      * GIS
      * Documentation

* **"Deadline" for presentation?** deadline for steps? estimated timeline?
* **Define what is and is not in our scope **- certain variables/scales out of scope?
* **Business case/need** - Provide methodology of modeling park access in the context of planning more quantitatively in order to reduce subjectivity in decision making.
* **Desired outcome** - 
  * Expand accessibility to this model to other users through availability of technology, clear documentation on technology and process.
  * Be able to confidently use this model as tool for decision making - clearly assessing cases based on established criteria
* Q's for Bonnie
  * software for our project structure
* Document WHY decisions were made



### To do list for next meeting:

Wednesday – develop agenda for Bonnie 

Next meeting – talk about scores 

Overarching deadline—coincide with prep for 5-year System Plan Update

GOAL: How can we reframe the analysis so that running the model is accessible to users

User Perspective

-	Create presentation 

-	Continue to improve and apply the EBPA Model

o	\[June 2018\] Develop a standardized evaluation of park access LOS for use in all future PRCR rezoning reviews

	Tools needed

	Interface

	WHAT WE DO RIGHT NOW:

•	Information flow chart

o	Current LOS, current LA, distance to closest park/greenway, impact of new development / park, etc.

•	Work flow description

o	Documents referenced, websites visited, software used, documentation recorded, communication, publishing, etc.

	HOW WE CAN DO IT BETTER:

o	\[Septemeber 2018\] Finalize criteria for analysis and identify priority areas for future park land acquisition

	Additional criteria for population growth, equity, etc.

o	\[December 2018?\] Expand the GIS model to evaluate access and connectivity to greenway trails, in addition to parks

	Add Greenway Planner 

•	When and how to add new people to the project?

o	\[December 2018\]  Enhance the GIS model to evaluate different levels of access 

	Variety of experience\(s\)

	Specific amenities on site

	Park Score \(quality indicator\)

	CIP investment history / Cityworks work order / preventative maintenance 

-	Use also for scenario testing of Neighborhood & Community Connections projects

Documentation

-	Immediate need: Memorialize what we’ve currently done

o	Focus: How to run the model

-	Develop protocol for documentation moving forward

-	Documenting decisions that get made as a group \(what networks to use, why scoring is done a certain way, etc.\) 

Data Management

-	Maintaining tier table

-	Managing scope \(e.g. Maintaining the full real estate inventory of PRCR-managed parcels; developing disposition criteria; etc.\) 

Roles & Responsibilities 

-	User review / validation of documentation for use of model

Questions:

Developing a project timeline

To-do List:

Develop list of variables and standard things to report on rezonings, to see what we can get into a user-friendly dashboard 

Presentation / Summary of EBPA model: How it works

Reference to Departmental Business Plan, System Plan, Strategic Plan…
