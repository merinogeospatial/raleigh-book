# Notes

### Try vector tiles for features so that labels are dynamic\(er\) in AGOL

* May need to get Ryan to publish as I do not have the rights

### Symbology for trails

* Top line layer - Marker fill by surface type. Circles and/or X's?
  * Marker placement &gt; placement template controls distance between markers
* Bottom line layer - larger size based on blaze color, makes translucent?
